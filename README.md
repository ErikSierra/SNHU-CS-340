How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?


Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is essential in software development. This involves modularizing code, documenting it clearly, maintaining consistent coding styles, implementing automated testing, using version control systems, and regularly refactoring code. For instance, encapsulating database operations in a CRUD Python module, as done in Project One and utilized in Project Two, promotes code reusability and separation of concerns. As a computer scientist, approaching problems involves breaking them down, analyzing requirements, designing solutions, and implementing them effectively. Handling client requests requires understanding their needs, communicating effectively, and delivering solutions that meet their objectives. Creating databases to meet client requests involves designing appropriate data models, implementing schemas, and optimizing queries. Ultimately, computer scientists play a crucial role in developing software solutions that enhance business efficiency, productivity, and decision-making.
